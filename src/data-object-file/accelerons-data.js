        <b>TEAM ACCELERONS</b> is a student-led engineering team of SAE NIT
        Kurukshetra. The feeling of speed and precision, the tactical aspects,
        the way car looks, the way it behaves, that first lap excitement and the
        intrigues that surround it, are the things that drives the team to
        DESIGN, BUILD and RACE formula-style cars for the Formula Bharat and
        SUPRA competitions. <br />
        From being a first-timer in <b>SUPRA 2014</b> to standing on top among

        you give up your hunger for success you are not racing full heartedly
        anymore. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
